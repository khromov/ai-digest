# ai-digest

A CLI tool to aggregate your codebase into a single Markdown file for use with Claude Projects or custom ChatGPTs.

## How to Use

Start by running the CLI tool in your project directory:

```bash
npx ai-digest
```

This will generate a `codebase.md` file with your codebase.

Once you've generated the Markdown file containing your codebase, you can use it with AI models like ChatGPT and Claude for code analysis and assistance.

## Features

- Aggregates all files in the specified directory and subdirectories
- Ignores common build artifacts and configuration files
- Outputs a single Markdown file containing the whole codebase
- Provides options for whitespace removal and custom ignore patterns
- View file size statistics with visual bar charts
- Watch mode for automatic rebuilding when files change

### With ChatGPT:

1. Create a Custom GPT
2. Upload the generated Markdown file to the GPT's knowledge base

### With Claude:

1. Create a new Project
2. Add the Markdown file to the Project's knowledge

For best results, re-upload the Markdown file before starting a new chat session to ensure the AI has the most up-to-date version of your codebase.

## Options

- `-i, --input <directories...>`: Specify input directories (multiple allowed, default: current directory)
- `-o, --output <file>`: Specify output file (default: codebase.md)
- `--no-default-ignores`: Disable default ignore patterns
- `--whitespace-removal`: Enable whitespace removal
- `--show-output-files [sort]`: Display a list of files with size statistics and bar charts. Add `sort` to sort by file size.
- `--ignore-file <file>`: Specify a custom ignore file (default: .aidigestignore)
- `--watch`: Enable watch mode to automatically rebuild when files change
- `--help`: Show help

## Examples

1. Basic usage:

   ```bash
   npx ai-digest
   ```

2. Specify input and output:

   ```bash
   npx ai-digest -i /path/to/your/project -o project_summary.md
   ```

3. Enable whitespace removal:

   ```bash
   npx ai-digest --whitespace-removal
   ```

4. Show files included with size statistics:

   ```bash
   npx ai-digest --show-output-files
   ```

5. Show files sorted by size (largest first):

   ```bash
   npx ai-digest --show-output-files sort
   ```

6. Watch mode:

   ```bash
   npx ai-digest --watch
   ```

7. Combine multiple options:

   ```bash
   npx ai-digest -i /path/to/your/project -o project_summary.md --whitespace-removal --show-output-files sort --watch
   ```

## Custom Ignore Patterns

ai-digest supports custom ignore patterns using a `.aidigestignore` file in the root directory of your project. This file works similarly to `.gitignore`, allowing you to specify files and directories that should be excluded from the aggregation.

Use the `--show-output-files` flag to see which files are being included, making it easier to identify candidates for exclusion.

## Whitespace Removal

When using the `--whitespace-removal` flag, ai-digest removes excess whitespace from files to reduce the token count when used with AI models. This feature is disabled for whitespace-dependent languages like Python and YAML.

## Binary and SVG File Handling

Binary files and SVGs are included in the output with a note about their file type. This allows AI models to be aware of these files without including their full content.

## Watch Mode

When using the `--watch` flag, ai-digest will continuously monitor your files for changes and automatically regenerate the output file whenever a relevant file is modified, added, or deleted. This is especially useful during development when you're making frequent changes to your codebase.

The watch mode:

- Respects all ignore patterns (both default and custom)
- Rebuilds only when non-ignored files change
- Includes a debounce mechanism to avoid multiple rebuilds when many files change at once
- Can be terminated with Ctrl+C

## Local Development

Run `npm run start` to run the CLI tool on the local project. (Very meta!)

Run `npm test` to run the tests.

To pass flags to the CLI, use the `--` flag, like this: `npm run start -- --whitespace-removal`.
